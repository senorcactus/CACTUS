         <h1>Frogs and where to find them</h1>

 <p>Frogs are pretty neat they can swim and jump. They usually live near the water like most animals. They are Green and can jump real far. Frogs like to ride unicycles.
      You can find frogs in the water around meme spawns. Some frogs are not secret and are blue and stuff they can poison you though
      and you will be sick</p>
